                The orca (Orcinus orca), or killer whale, is a toothed whale that is the largest member of the oceanic dolphin family. It is the only extant species in the genus Orcinus. Orcas are recognizable by their black-and-white patterned body. 
                A cosmopolitan species, they are found in diverse marine environments, from Arctic to Antarctic regions to tropical seas.

                Orcas are apex predators with a diverse diet. Individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. This includes a variety of fish, sharks, rays, and marine mammals such as seals and other dolphins and whales. They are highly social; some populations are composed of highly stable matrilineal family groups (pods). 
                Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviors, often specific to a particular group and passed along from generation to generation, are considered to be manifestations of animal culture.

                Orcas are not usually a threat to humans, and no fatal attack has ever been documented in their natural habitat. There have been cases of captive orcas killing or injuring their handlers at marine theme parks. 
                Orcas also feature strongly in the mythologies of indigenous cultures, and their reputation in different cultures ranges from being the souls of humans to merciless killers.

                Orcas, or killer whales, are among the most intelligent and social marine mammals, belonging to the dolphin family. They are known for their striking black and white coloration, with males often reaching lengths of up to 32 feet and weighing as much as 11,000 pounds. 
                These apex predators exhibit diverse hunting strategies and can be found in oceans around the world, from the icy waters of the Arctic to warm tropical seas. Orcas are highly social animals, living in matrilineal pods that can consist of up to 40 individuals. 
                These pods have complex social structures and communicate using a variety of vocalizations, which can differ between pods, almost like dialects.

                Different populations have specialized hunting techniques and prey preferences, showcasing their adaptability and intelligence. For instance, transient orcas are known for their stealth and speed when hunting seals, while resident orcas primarily feed on fish, particularly salmon. 
                Their role as apex predators helps maintain the balance of marine ecosystems, making them vital to ocean health. Conservation efforts are increasingly important, as many orca populations face threats from pollution, habitat loss, and diminishing prey due to overfishing.
